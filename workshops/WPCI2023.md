As a follow-up to the [Winter 2022 Workshop on Prefixes, CURIEs, and IRIs](WPCI2022.md),
we are hosting the 2023 edition of the workshop with an emphasis on community discussion
and the following goals:

1. Reflect on progress since last year's workshop
2. Showcase new tools, workflow, and philosophies
3. Collect and describe current use cases and pain points related to prefixes, prefix maps, CURIEs, and IRIs in the
   biomedical domain
4. Provide a discussion forum on key issues
