title: Winter 2022 Workshop on Prefixes, CURIEs, and IRIs
---

## Purpose

As a follow-up to the [Fall 2021 Workshop on Prefixes, CURIEs, and IRIs](WPCI2021.md),
[INDRA labs](https://indralab.github.io) at Harvard Medical School hosted a 2022 edition of the workshop with a
slightly shorter duration and a greater focus on community discussion and the following goals:

1. Reflect on progress since last year's workshop
2. Showcase new tools, workflow, and philosophies
3. Collect and describe current use cases and pain points related to prefixes, prefix maps, CURIEs, and IRIs in the
   biomedical domain
4. Provide a discussion forum on key issues

## Summary of Main Discussion Points

Several participants prepared questions and discussion points on
the [Google Doc](https://bit.ly/winter-2022-prefix-workshop)
ahead of time. During the workshop, participants actively took notes and added additional points to the document.
When the discussion forum of the workshop began, discussion centered around the following issues:

- Expanding the scope of Bioregistry to cover other scientific domains (e.g., environmental biology, taxonomy)
- As developers, maintainers, and users of tools like the Bioregistry, how do we prepare educational materials for
  potential users of our tools and, more generally, how do we educate normal scientists, funding bodies, and publishers
  of the importance of good semantics?
- How to reconcile community- and project-specific variants of content from the Bioregistry (e.g., using
  the [contexts](https://bioregistry.io/context/) feature)
- Security concerns for meta-resolvers, such as person-in-the-middle attacks
- Mirroring the base Bioregistry or making deployments with a custom subset or additional custom content
- Improving the connection from Bioregistry to other registries and de-duplicating effort
